# Roadmap_shop

I have created this site to help learner get the roadmap of there desired skill in one place and
so that they don't have to spend more time searching for right direction rather than learning the skill and
I have nearly completed all the feature and i have coded the backend also and added authentication.
basically i have done alot of small backend project like todo-list,blog-pages and real-time chat and many more.. 
but this is the one of project i have done on large scale 
and one more thing i haven't added mongoose to this.
